# spark-in-production

This repo demonstrates how to set up local development environment for work with spark engine using dev containers and 
deploy spark code to production Spark cluster in Azure Databricks. 

Repo is based on a sample that sets up data ingestion system using Azure Event Hubs, connects it to Azure Databricks to process 
the messages coming through and saves them to Azure Data Lake.
